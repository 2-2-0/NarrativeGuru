# NarrativeGuru
A simple tool for writers and story creators - it is meant to be used along Gemini AI


INSTALLATION
Copy the file to the folder of your choice and run it from there by either typing "python narrative-guru.py" on a command line. The database will be created on the directory you run the app from.

You can always make a "formal" installation by assigning it a proper directory on your applications folders, and create a menu entry from there.

USAGE
Create a new project, create your characters, locations and props with detail using any AI app and export them as JSON files. Copy these to each of the entities you are creating in NarrativeGuru.

Each time you need them, just double click on the resources catalogs at the left of the screen and finally copy the whole remix station window to the clipboard, then paste into the AI again to obtain consistent features for your creations.
